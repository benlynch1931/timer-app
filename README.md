# Timer Application
## By Ben Lynch


This is a mobile application designed to help with multi-tasking, but generating timers automaticall for the user.

The original use-case for this application was for cooking.


## How it Works

You can create Presets of tasks, these task so assign a duration
When you start the preset, the application will calculate and create timers for each task in the preset.

This means you don't have to set them yourself or work out the timings - this is all taken care of
